# Diffusion Models and Their Applications: A Deep Dive (CS492(D)-Based Repository)

This repository is inspired by KAIST's Lecture **CS492(D): Diffusion Models and Their Applications**. Its purpose is to provide an extended and enriched understanding of diffusion models, covering areas where students might find the lecture materials less intuitive or lacking in depth.

We aim to complement the original lecture slides with:

- Additional explanations for challenging concepts.
- Comprehensive mathematical details.

This repository is created solely for **educational purposes** and has no commercial intent. It is designed to assist students and researchers in better understanding diffusion models by providing accessible and well-organized materials.

### Current and Future Plans

We are committed to expanding this repository to include the following resources:

1. Upload **Extra DDD (Diffusion Deep Dive) Slides**: Enhanced versions of the original slides with more details and insights.
2. Provide **Assignment Solutions** and **Extra Codes**: Detailed solutions to existing assignments and additional codes for deeper exploration.
3. Share **Lecture Recordings**: Video materials for students to review or learn at their own pace.

### To-Do List

- [ ] Upload all **Extra DDD Slides**.
- [ ] Add solutions to existing assignments and upload **Extra Codes for Understanding**.
- [ ] Publish lecture recordings.

Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to contribute or provide feedback to help improve this repository!
